### 1️⃣ Component Inspector
- Explore your Vue components in-depth.
- Monitor **props**, **data**, and **methods** to quickly spot bugs or issues.
- Example: Check why a prop isn’t passed or if data isn’t updating as expected.

### 2️⃣ Timeline
- Analyze component re-renders to identify performance bottlenecks.
- Visualize the flow of state changes and interactions in real-time.

### 3️⃣ Events & State Management
- Track **real-time state changes** and manage component events efficiently.
- Vuex or Pinia integration helps you debug every mutation and action.

## 🎯 Quick Example: Debugging Vuex State with Vue DevTools

Here’s how you can use Vue DevTools to monitor Vuex state:

### Vue Component Example

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <h1>{{ counter }}</h1>
    <button @click="increment">Increment</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
export default {
  computed: {
    counter() {
      return this.$store.state.counter;
    },
  },
  methods: {
    increment() {
      this.$store.commit('increment');
    },
  },
};
</script>
```

### Vuex Store Example

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue';
import Vuex from 'vuex';

Vue.use(Vuex);

export default new Vuex.Store({
  state: {
    counter: 0,
  },
  mutations: {
    increment(state) {
      state.counter++;
    },
  },
});
```

### Debugging Steps
1. Open Vue DevTools and go to the **Vuex** tab.
2. Watch the `counter` state update as you click the "Increment" button.
3. Check the **mutation history** to see when and how the state changed.

## ⚡ Pro Tip: Optimize Heavy Components

Use the **Timeline** feature to identify components that re-render frequently. Optimize them using:
- **Lazy Loading**: Dynamically load components only when needed.
- **Selective Re-Rendering**: Use `v-once` or `computed` properties to prevent unnecessary updates.
