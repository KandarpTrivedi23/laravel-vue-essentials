# Boosting Reusability with Custom Hooks in the Composition API

The Vue Composition API is a game-changer for building scalable, modular apps. At the heart of this API are **custom hooks**â€”standalone functions that encapsulate reusable logic for cleaner, more maintainable code. Letâ€™s break down the benefits!

---

## What Are Custom Hooks?

Custom hooks are reusable functions that simplify complex logic, keeping components focused on display and UI. Theyâ€™re great for managing reactive data and computed properties consistently across components.

## Why Use Custom Hooks?

- **Cleaner Components**  
  Custom hooks move logic out of components, making them more readable.

- **Reduced Redundancy**  
  Use hooks for common tasks like data fetching and form handling, cutting down on duplicate code.

- **Easier Maintenance**  
  Update a hook once, and all components using it benefit immediately.

Example:  
```javascript
// useCounter.js
import { reactive } from 'vue';

export function useCounter() {
    const state = reactive({
        count: 0,
    });

    const increment = () => {
        state.count += 1;
    };

    return { state, increment };
}
