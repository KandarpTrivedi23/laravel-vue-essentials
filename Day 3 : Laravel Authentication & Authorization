Vue.js + Laravel Series: Authentication & Authorization

We’re now into Authentication and Authorization — essential steps to ensure secure access and a seamless user experience in your applications.

Why Secure Authentication Matters?
In modern web applications, safeguarding sensitive user data builds trust and credibility. By implementing JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with Laravel Sanctum and securing routes with Vue Router Guards, we can create a robust foundation for user authentication and authorization.

Step-by-Step Guide: Integrating JWT and Laravel Sanctum

1. Set Up Laravel Sanctum for Token-Based Authentication
Sanctum provides a simple, powerful way to handle authentication for both SPAs and APIs. Here’s what we’ll cover:
• Installing and configuring Sanctum in Laravel
• Generating secure tokens for users upon login

2. Securing Your Vue.js App with Route Guards
Vue Router Guards let us control access to specific routes, ensuring only authenticated users can view protected pages. This step includes:
• Setting up Navigation Guards in Vue Router
• Redirecting unauthorized users and handling token expiration gracefully

3. Managing Tokens Securely
For a secure experience, it’s crucial to handle tokens carefully. Here’s what we’ll discuss:
• Where to store JWTs in the client (local storage or cookies?)
• Strategies for managing sessions, logout, and token refresh
