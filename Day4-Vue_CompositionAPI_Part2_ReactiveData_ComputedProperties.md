# Reactive Data and Computed Properties with the Composition API

In our last post, we introduced the Vue Composition API and why itâ€™s essential for building scalable applications. Now, letâ€™s explore how it improves state management with **reactive data** and **computed properties**.

## Reactive Data: More Flexible State Management

With the Composition API, you can create reactive data more flexibly, allowing for dynamic state changes that automatically update across the application. This approach:

- **Allows Multiple Properties to React**  
  Manage multiple reactive properties within a single reactive state.

- **Simplifies State Management**  
  Organize and manage your reactive data logically.

Example:  
```javascript
import { reactive } from 'vue';

export default {
    setup() {
        const state = reactive({
            count: 0,
            message: 'Hello, Vue!'
        });

        const increment = () => {
            state.count += 1;
        };

        return { state, increment };
    }
};
