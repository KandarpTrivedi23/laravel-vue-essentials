# Reactive Data and Computed Properties with the Composition API

In our last post, we introduced the Vue Composition API and why it’s essential for building scalable applications. Now, let’s explore how it improves state management with reactive data and computed properties.

## Reactive Data: More Flexible State Management
With the Composition API, you can create reactive data more flexibly, allowing for dynamic state changes that automatically update across the application. This approach:
- Allows multiple properties to react within a single reactive state.
- Simplifies state management by organizing reactive data logically.

## Computed Properties: Calculations Made Easy
Using the Composition API for computed properties lets you:
- Create more efficient calculations that automatically re-evaluate when dependencies change.
- Enhance readability, especially in larger components where complex logic might previously have been scattered.

By managing state this way, the Composition API enables a smoother workflow and a cleaner, more organized codebase.
